**Lesson 15**

This week we were in a different computer lab, with different computers. However we were still doing the same old tutorials, which I have now finished. We will now be working in pairs to try and create our own program for the micro:bit to run. I am working with Max. I have found that you must use previous knowledge, well, to be able to create, and think of your own game.
