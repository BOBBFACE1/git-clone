**Lesson 12**

This week, we looked at Javascript a bit more. Some people had been finding it hard to create programs on this, however I have been finding it quite easy, as I have thought about what the best way to tell a simple-minded computer, what to do.

This week we looked at some of the tutorials on Javascript, but they were being a bit dodgy, in the way that, what we did, did not register in the program. Part of the programming chunks section is called snippets, where you can put a chunk, to bring out later. Unfortunately, if you went out of chunks, it deleted everything in it.

I used the written instructions we had, instead, and completed the tutorials that way. But, once again, something went wrong, in that, every time I went into plain code, it stuck, and I could not get back.

Though I almost completed the 3rd tutorial, I was concentrating more on these problems, then anything else, meaning I failed to do anything that taught me something new.
