**Lesson 2**

This lesson we have learned that advertising almost always shows you a fantasy, but does this without lying.

Take, for example, a small child has just seen an advert for a new toy car that is portrayed as a cartoon that drives around on it's own. They ask their parents for it because of this, and they think they really want it. When the toy car actually arrives, it turns out to be your average piece of tacky plastic. The young child is then very upset.

For somewhere like mcdonalds they will take a long time to do a simple photoshoot of a perfect burger. When people then buy the burger they think about what they saw in the advert, and sometimes will not think about the look of the burger they actually receive.
