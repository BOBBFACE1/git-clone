**Lesson 13**

Today, we did some more of the tutorials, on Javascript. I think I have managed to find out a way to make a score (the extension) however, I don't think it is what other people have in mind. Unfortunately, I can not test this, as Javascript will not let me run my code.

This week, I have learned that it is quite simple to make a dot move across the micro bit. All you have to do is use the variable .tilty, and some ifs. Most things are quite possible to code, if you simply use LOGIC.
