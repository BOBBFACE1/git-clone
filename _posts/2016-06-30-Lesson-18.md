**Lesson 18**

This lesson we received our Micro:bits! After months of waiting, they finally arrived. We looked at these for about 20-25 minutes, before actually getting on with doing the planned lesson. They are tiny! Until today, I had no idea that they were actually a literal "bit" of the original BBC Micro computer. You have to imagine a **small** piece of hardware, and then take a **bite sized** **chunk** (literally!) out of that.

For the planned lesson, we were looking at what we were scared of on the internet. Many people are scared of paedophiles and groomers.

For homework we were told to research sexting, and revenge porn **NEWS ARTICLES.**

Here is the sexting article I found:

Here is the revenge porn article I found:
