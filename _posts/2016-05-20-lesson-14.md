**Lesson 14**

This week we did some more coding.

We were taught that Javascript runs on curly braces () and semicolons ;. If any of these are not in the right place, then it will get very confused. It is very easy to make a mistake like this, which mean that you have to go through the whole code to check for your error. I have learnt that this means you must be very careful, when coding.
