**Lesson 17**

This lesson, I learned a few things that you should check if your blog is not working. I had so many different changes to mine, that I had to start over! If there are any symbols, that aren't dashes, in your title, then it will break the website. I had done this in many of my first posts that I had created. I knew it was a problem, but not such a major problem that it is, when two posts are titled the same. This also breaks the website, and was something that I had accidently done.
