Lesson 11

This week we used "microsoft touchdevelop" to make a “Harry Potter thinking hat”. We followed a tutorial on how to do this, before thinking about what each part of the code we created did. Afterwards, we were told to recreate this using our own devices, but starting with “on shake” instead of “on press a”, and with our school houses, instead of the Hogwarts ones.

After this, we had to try and do the same thing, but in javascript instead. This proved tricky for many, but I looked at the logic of the script, and quickly worked it out.
