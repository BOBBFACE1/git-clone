Lesson 3

This lesson we talked about the advantages and disadvantages of social media.

Social media can be a way to contact friends or relatives, at distance. Kids can confer on homework, or catch up on the latest gossip. It can be the easy way to find a job, advertise a business, or organise meetings/ meet ups. It means you can chat whilst playing a game with someone on the other side of the world. It can even be a way of simply entertaining each other, and showing each other cool things that you would never see showing up on TV, like on youtube.

But all of this comes with a priceâ€¦

As soon as you start using social media, you are at risk of falling into the trap of: grooming, cyberbullying,  child porn, and many more. Social media can lead to you coming under a lot of harm, unless you are careful.
