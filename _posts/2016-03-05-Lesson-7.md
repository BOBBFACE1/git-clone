**_Lesson 7_**

This week, we looked at internet safety, and how things can go wrong when you post the wrong things online, for yourself and for other people.

We watched a video made by CEOP called first to a million. An older brother challenges his teenage sister to a challenge of who could get to 1 million views, for a video on youtube, first. It started off with silly things like the cinnamon challenge, and stupid dancing. But as the competition went on, they started getting rude comments about some of the people in the vids. The competition eventually got out of hand, and the kids all ended up in bad situations. For some of them this meant they wanted to hid away, and cease to exist, while others had to have counseling.

I leant that you should always think before you post, and try not to get caught in something that could end badly, and if you do, to tell someone.
