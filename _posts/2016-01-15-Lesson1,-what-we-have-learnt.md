What we have learned

This lesson we have learnt that media is almost always made to make you see things a certain way. What we see in media changes the way we live our lives, and sometimes our perception of reality. Advertisements are often some of the strongest influencing types of media, because they are built, simply for that purpose, with a lot of subtext behind them. Another example of a strong influencing media is video games. Especially to people of my own age (11-13) whatever is on the best video games is the "best thing". People always talk about Fifa, and something like Call Of Duty (COD) could lead to real life violence at an older age. 

When people see some media they often interpret it differently to how someone else would. The media designer may try to make yourself feel envious that someone else may have a better car than you, but someone may instead think: "only rich snobs have those, and I'm not one of them." It could have the opposite effect.

Adverts, for example, often portray our own culture and general thoughts, which then reappear in our lives, and so the circle continues. Ads often portray messages like "A famous life is a good one." or “Nice hair makes you more “cool” and interesting.” One that we saw in the new kia advert was “Fat is bad.”

Some people think that social media is a bad thing, whereas others say it is a good thing. Social media is a way for people to be able to talk to each other, and send pictures, without distance being a problem. One of the main problems is that you don't know who you are talking to, anybody could be anybody. People could find out your personal details and do terrible things with them. A counter argument against this, is that it is your choice how much personal data you share. The reason things like facebook have an age minimum of 13 is because you are deemed incapable of making these decisions under this age.
