**Lesson 20**

This lesson, we looked at things to be careful of on the internet. There are many cases when people don't know that what they are doing is wrong or dangerous. Some illegal things that you can find on the internet are: child porn, revenge porn, rape porn, and beast porn. The thing that these all have in common is the lack of consent. An example where there is a lack of respect is when a boyfriend/girlfriend asks their partner if they want to kiss, the other person says no, but is then forced to. Often the person think that there is nothing wrong with this, and that they are entitled. However this is not true.

There are also other things to be careful of, on the internet. E.g. you may be looking at some pictures of IS/ISIS/daesh killing people, and trying to find the most gruesome pictures with your mates, not realising that you are violating the anti-terrorist laws. We were told a story of some young people, who were teasing someone in Pakistan because of the person's name. As it turns out, the person they were teasing was an ISIS recruiter, who was being investigated by the police.

**YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL ON THE INTERNET, YOU COULD END UP DOING BAD WITHOUT RELEASING.**
