**_Lesson 5_**

This lesson we looked at how there are different ways that you can portray yourself on social media. Once on a social media website, you can set your identity to be anything you want it to be. We then thought about what we had portrayed ourselves as on social media, and if we did not use social media, then how we were going to, on our identity posters.
